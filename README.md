# Protecting your child's online classes

As many of you might have noted over the past few days there are [increasing reports](https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/business/two-us-state-ags-seek-info-on-zoom-s-privacy-practices-12608702) of unwanted participants on Zoom meetings. [MOE has suspended usage of Zoom](https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/moe-suspends-zoom-home-based-learning-obscene-images-12626534) at this time and at Nurture we are *aware, concerned and actively* taking steps to prevent such incidents from taking place.

> **We recognize that all platforms can be misused and simply switching to another provider without deep understanding of the risks and the root cause is not the solution.** 

After thorough evaluation and consultation with technology partners, we believe that the high profile of the reported disruptions is in part due to the solution's wide adoption and its simplicity. The settings that allow Zoom be be abused *can* been effectively managed by a combination of good default settings to remove human error as well as **teachers**, **parents** and **students** playing their part.

## Ok how do we manage this?

### Good Defaults

The default settings on Zoom makes it easy to use, such as one-click clinks and allowing participants to get into a meeting easily without passwords and approvals. Now that Zoom adoption has grow more than twenty fold, those same settings that made connecting people so easy now [place these meetings at risk](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/09/technology/zoom-security.html).

We have adapted [Standford University's guidelines](https://uit.stanford.edu/service/zoom/meetingsecurityguide) for managing Zoom meetings aimed at preventing and managing occurrences as they are clear and practical. These materials are available at for parents and teachers to download and print at a [webpage](http://hblsupport.nurture.com.sg) we have set up for the purpose of supporting home based learning. We have also briefed and trained our teachers to adopt these practices to specifically prevent such incidents from happening and have made the secure settings default.

A list of the default settings we enforce are as follows:
- MUTE ALL PARTICIPANTS UPON ENTRY - **enable**
- SCREEN SHARING - set to **host only**
- WAITING ROOM - set to **all participants**

### Teachers Checklist and Training

Our teachers' pre-meeting checklist double confirms that indeed the settings are adhered to:
- Assign your principal or someone who is comfortable with IT to co-host
- Disable “join before host’ in your Personal Meeting Room
- Created a unique ID for each online class
- Require a password when scheduling a meeting
- Create a [waiting room](https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/115000332726-Waiting-Room) so that parents can only join the class if their child’s name is
displayed
- Once you have verified that this is your child’s name, allow you child to join in
- Mute all participants upon entry
- Restrict screen sharing to host only
- Lock meeting 5 mins after you have begun
- Created a [waiting room](https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/115000332726-Waiting-Room) names have been screened and verified by the teacher
- Only you are allowed to share their screens to ensure the safety of the content
shared
- Classroom will be locked once the class begins
- Do not click on any link that appears during the online class
- End the class immediately by pressing END meeting should you see any
inappropriate content and join back again

One additional day (Monday) has been designated to doublecheck on the default settings and to diseminate materials as well as train teachers so classes will commence on Tuesday, one day later than planned.

### Parents & Students help

- Meeting details need to kept private. No amount of security controls on any platform will keep strangers out if someone hands them the keys.
- Parents should set the Zoom display names to their children's names for attendance taking and to ensure smooth entry into the class from the [waiting room](https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/115000332726-Waiting-Room).
- As the situation remains fluid, stay informed in prearranged communication channels such as LittleLives

### Dedicated support channels

We have set up a dedicated support channel to support our staff and parents as they conduct remote lessons and are continuing to monitor the situation. The benefits of using a high profile platform is also that many clear and concise security practices have emerged very quickly as well as very high pressure on our chosen platform to continue to make security controls easier and more transparent to users.

### Lastly..

If knowing all this still does not reassure you, we completely understand. The reports are indeed very frightening and you are well within reason to take any steps you feel are required to protect your child. Our classes remain completely optional for students with supplementary offline resources to assist you.

Rest assured, protecting our students and staff from such abuse is a very high priority and we seek your understanding as we all learn and adapt to these challenging times.
